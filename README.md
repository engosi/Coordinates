# Usage

To use Coordinates.exe, simply run the executable. You may need to restart it once for it to function correctly.
Features
# Seed Information

At the top of the interface, you can find the seed of the active instance.
# Stronghold Coordinates

Below the seed information, you can access the stronghold coordinates for both the Nether and Overworld.
# Closest Nether Fortress

Directly underneath the stronghold coordinates, you can discover the location of the closest Nether Fortress to coordinates 0,0. Please note that this feature may occasionally not work as expected.
# Buttons

    Reload: The reload button serves the same purpose as pressing F7, refreshing the program to detect a new seed.

    Suspend (Susp): This button allows you to suspend your active Minecraft instance. Essentially, it freezes the instance, allowing you to perform other tasks.

    Unsuspend (Ususp): Use this button to unsuspend your Minecraft instance after it has been suspended.

# Hotkeys

    F7: Pressing F7 triggers the program reload, enabling it to detect a new seed.
